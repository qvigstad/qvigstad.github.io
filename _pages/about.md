As a hematologist at Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, I have a diverse clinical practice, including the management of hemophilia, coagulation disorders, and leukemia. My specific expertise lies in hemophilia, where I focus on the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of this bleeding disorder. In addition to my clinical work, I am actively involved in research aimed at advancing the understanding and treatment of hemophilia.
