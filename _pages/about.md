As a hematologist at Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, I manage a wide range of blood disorders, including hemophilia, coagulation disorders, and leukemia. 

My primary area of expertise is hemophilia, where I specialize in the diagnosis, treatment approaches, and long-term care for patients with this bleeding disorder. 

In addition to my clinical duties, I pursue research efforts focused on advancing the understanding and improving the treatment options for hemophilia.
